GUI -> Controller -> server -> poker

Player clicks an action button. Controller checks to see if it is the current user's turn
If so it sends the action to the server.

The server sends the move to the poker (logic)
Poker returns if the move is valid and makes changes to itself.
Server sends if the move was valid to the specific user.

Server reads information from poker and uses it to update state.
It sends any part of the state that changed to each user.
Controller uses the part of state that changed to update its full state.
Every frame? the Controller sends its full state to assets.
