Each move should start with table.can_move() to determine if the current player
can make an action. If this results in False table.end_move() should be called

Otherwise, table.single_move() should be called this will call table.end_move()
from within the method and return the result of table.end_move()

table.end_move() returns if the round should end
If it returns true table.end_round() should be called
